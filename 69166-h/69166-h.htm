<p class="drop-capy">VIRTUE, say moralists, is so transcendently beautiful,
that she need but be <em>seen</em>, to be universally
admired: and is not <span class="allsmcap">VICE</span> so hateful, that the
more its features are <em>viewed</em>, the more it will be avoided?
The traffic in the human species, particularly
as carried on by the Europeans on the coast
of Africa, has so horrible an aspect, that nothing,
one should think, but the <span class="smcap">Mask</span>, under which it
has been concealed, could have prevented all the civilized
nations in the world uniting to drive the detested
Monster from the face of the earth. This
<span class="smcap">Mask</span> is, however, at length taken away, and the
traffic stands exposed in all its real, unalterable deformity.
The <span class="smcap">People</span> are now called upon to behold,
to feel, and judge for themselves. The representations
of former writers on this subject were
roundly denied; the facts they stated were not only
contradicted, but deemed impossible, and the authors
themselves were accused of slander. Now we have
a body of <span class="allsmcap">EVIDENCE</span> to which to appeal; of evidence,
possessing every essential of <em>credibility</em>. The
witnesses have declared before the Select Committee
of the House of Commons, what they themselves
saw: they had the best opportunities of observation,
and they are disinterested. And now it appears, that
one half of the tale of human misery hath not been
told: and that every principle, that can bind a man<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
of honour and conscience,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> loudly calls for the prohibition
of the iniquitous traffic. Hard indeed must
those hearts be, and inaccessible those understandings,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
which such evidence cannot reach!</p>

<p>The Evidence delivered before the Select Committee
of the House of Commons is very voluminous,
occupying two thousand pages in folio. But a judicious
Abstract and Arrangement of the Evidence,
on the Part of the Petitioners for the Abolition of
the Slave Trade,<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> has been published, and in a short
compass, contains the evidence of well informed persons
on that subject.</p>

<p>In the <span class="smcap">Preface</span> to this important volume of evidence
we read of rewards offered for taking run-away
negroes <em>alive or dead</em>—of laws being required to be
made to prevent the practice of <em>cutting off ears, noses,
and tongues</em>—of <em>breaking limbs</em> and <em>putting out
eyes</em>—to prevent <em>distempered, maimed, and worn out
negroes</em> from infesting towns—to prevent <em>aged</em> and
<em>infirm</em> negroes being driven from the plantations <em>to
starve</em>. We meet also with such kind of <span class="allsmcap">PREAMBLES</span>
to acts as the following, viz.</p>

<p>‘Whereas the extreme cruelty and inhumanity of
the managers, overseers, and book-keepers of estates,
have frequently driven slaves into the woods, and occasioned
rebellions, internal insurrections, &amp;c. And
whereas also it frequently happens, that slaves come
to their deaths by hasty and severe blows and other
improper treatment of overseers and book-keepers,
in the heat of passion; and when such accidents do
happen, the victims are entered in the plantation-books,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
as having died of convulsions, fits, or other
causes not to be accounted for; and to conceal the
real truth of the cause of the death of such slave or
slaves, he or they is or are immediately put under
ground, &amp;c. Other preambles of a similar complexion,
respecting the lodging, food, and clothes of negroes,
are here to be met with. We also find that
run-away negroes, when advertised, are described by
the various brands upon their shoulders, breasts,
cheeks, and foreheads. A woman is described with
a wooden leg; a man as having both his ears cropt,
and another by his nose and ears being cut off.’
Cornwall Chronicle, Nov. 7, 1789. Other instances
occur within the year 1791.</p>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">FIRST CHAPTER</span> contains an account of the
Enormities committed by the Natives of Africa on
the persons of one another, to procure slaves for the
Europeans, proved by the testimony of such as have
visited that continent—and confirmed by accounts
from the slaves themselves, after their arrival in the
West-Indies.</p>

<p>Under this head, we learn that Kidnapping, or as
the natives call it, Panyaring, is very common, that
war is made on purpose to procure slaves. The
king’s soldiers set fire to villages in the night, and
seize the wretched inhabitants as they attempt to
escape from the flames, and many perish, either by the
fire or sword, in the execution of this horrid purpose.
A Boy, who was carried away in the night
from his father’s house, says, he believes both his
parents were killed, he is sure that one was, and that
many others were killed and some taken. Various
instances are mentioned of consummate treachery employed
in making captives. Kidnapping is professionally
followed; large parties go up the country three<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
hundred miles to drive down captives—they go a
wood-ranging, and pick up every one they meet, and
strip them naked. The purchasers generally say,
they do not care how the sellers come by their
slaves. Many are sold for crimes falsely imputed;
the Judges <ins class="corr" id="tn-6" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'participate the profits'">
participate in the profits</ins> of the sale, and are
therefore strongly induced to condemn the innocent.
Crimes are invented and multiplied for the purpose
of traffic. The great men dress up and employ women,
to entice young men to be connected with them,
that they may be convicted of adultery and sold. The
slaves are separated without the least regard to ties of
consanguinity, or the pathetic expostulations and remonstrances
of nature. When slave-ships are on the
Coast the natives go armed, but are no where safe.
The man, invited to drink with his neighbour, on rising
to go, is seized by two of them and a large dog:
and this mode of seizure is common.</p>

<p>By the Second Chapter it appears that the Europeans,
by means of the trade in slaves, are the occasion
of the before-mentioned enormities; that they
sometimes use additional means to excite the natives
to practise them, often attempt themselves to steal
the natives, and succeed, force trade as they please,
and are guilty of injustice in their dealings. In proof
of this charge, we learn from the evidence that Africans
receive European goods in exchange for slaves—that
they declare when ships cease to come (as in
times of war) slaves cease to be taken. African
dealers make the Princes drunk, in order to overcome
their aversion to unprovoked war: they furnish the
natives with arms and ammunition and excite them
to pillage.</p>

<p>The term war, in Africa, is used in general to
signify pillage; and when many towns are seen blazing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
in the night, the natives say war is carrying on.</p>

<p>The Traders advance goods to Chiefs to induce
them to seize their subjects or neighbours. Capt.
Patterson set two villages at variance, and brought
prisoners from both sides. It is not uncommon to
make the natives drunk, and then buy them. General
Rooke says, that it was proposed to him by three
English captains of ships, to kidnap a hundred, or a
hundred and fifty men, women, and children, king
Damel’s subjects, who had come to Goree in consequence
of the friendly intercourse between him and
Damel: He refused and was much shocked by the
proposition. They said such things had been done
by a former governor. Two men, black traders,
were invited on board, intoxicated, and captured
when asleep. The Gregson’s people, in running down
the coast, kidnapped thirty-two of the natives. The
Dobson’s boat of Liverpool had stolen a man and woman;
the captain on the remonstrance of Capt.
Briggs, who told him, there would be no more trade
if he did not deliver up his two captives, restored
them; upon which the natives loaded a boat with
yams, goats, fowls, honey, and palm wine, and would
take nothing for them,—a striking instance of forgiveness
of injuries, and of unmerited kindness!</p>

<p>We then meet with as opposite an exhibition of
character as can possibly be conceived: three or four
hundred Africans cruelly massacreed or carried off,
by means of the treacherous contrivance of six English
captains in Old Calabar River. But let us “turn
our eyes for relief to some ordinary wickedness”<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>:
Some consider frauds as a necessary part of the traffic;
they put false heads into powder casks, cut off
two or three yards from the middle of a piece of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
cloth, adulterate spirits, and steal back articles given.
Besides these, there are others who pay in bottles,
which hold but half the contents of the samples
shewn; use false steel-yards and weights, and sell
such guns as burst on firing; so that many of the
natives of the windward coast, are without their fingers
and thumbs on this account, and it has become
a saying that these guns kill more out of the butt
than the muzzle.</p>

<p>The Third Chapter contains an account of the
transactions of the enslaved Africans, and of the method
of confining, airing, feeding, and exercising
them; incidents on the passage, and the manner of
selling them when arrived at their destined ports; the
deplorable situation of the refuse or sickly slaves; separation
of relations and friends; mortality on the
passage, and frequently after sale; and the causes of
this mortality.</p>

<p>On being brought on board, says Dr. Trotter,
they shew signs of extreme distress and despair, from
a feeling of their situation, and regret at being torn
from their friends and connexions. They sometimes
dream of being in their own country, and when they
awake shew their despair by howling and shrieking in
a most dreadful manner. The women go into fits.
In the course of the voyage, the slaves are chained to
the deck every day from eight in the morning to four
o’clock in the afternoon. They are fed twice a day
with rice, yams, and horse-beans, and now and then
a little beef and bread: after each of these two meals
they are allowed half a pint of water: and are forced
to jump in their irons, which, by the slave dealers,
is called making them dance. This exercise frequently
occasions the fetters to excoriate their limbs; and,
when it is very painful to move at all, they are compelled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
to dance by a cat-of-nine-tails. The captains
order them to sing, and they sing songs of sorrow,
the subject of which are their wretched situation, and
the idea of never returning home: the witness remembers
the very words upon these occasions.</p>

<p>The slaves are so crouded below, that it is impossible
to walk among them without treading upon them.
Dr. Trotter has seen the slaves drawing their breath
with all those laborious and anxious efforts for life,
which are observed in expiring animals, subjected by
experiment to foul air, or in the exhausted receiver
of an air pump: they cry out—‘we are dying,’ and
many are irrecoverably lost by suffocation, having had
no previous signs of indisposition. They are closely
wedged together, and have not so much room as a
man in his coffin, either in length or breadth. They
sometimes go down well at night, and are found dead
in the morning. Alexander Falconbridge was never
among them for ten minutes together below, but his
shirt was as wet as if dipped in water. Sometimes
the dead and living are found shackled together.
They lie on the bare blanks, and the prominent parts
of their bones, about the shoulder-blade and knees,
have frequently been seen bare. No situation can be
conceived so dreadful and disgusting as that of slaves
when ill of the flux. In the Alexander (A. Falconbridge
says) the deck was covered with blood and mucus,
and resembled a slaughter-house; the stench and
foul air were intolerable. The slaves, shackled together,
frequently quarrel, and make a great disturbance.
Some refuse food and medicine, and declare
they want to die. In such cases compulsion is used.
The ships are so fitted up as to prevent, by net-work,
the slaves jumping overboard; notwithstanding which
they often attempt it, and sometimes succeed, shewing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
signs of exultation in the very jaws of death.
Some employ other means to destroy themselves, and
others go mad: Some resolve to starve, and means
are ineffectually used to wrench open their teeth: they
persist in their resolution, and effect their purpose,
in spite of the utmost pains to prevent it. When
severely chastised for not taking their food they have
looked up with a smile and said, “presently we shall
be no more.” <ins class="corr" id="tn-10" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'The thumscrew is'">
The thumbscrew is</ins> an instrument of
torture, the application of it sometimes occasions
mortifications, of which the negroes die. An instance
occurs of the cruelty of a captain to an infant
only nine months old, which one would suppose too
shocking to be true, were it not corroborated by other
specimens of as great cruelty in various parts of the
evidence. After a series of tortures the infant expired,
and its savage murderer, not yet satiated, would
suffer none of the people on deck to throw the body
overboard, but called the Mother, the wretched Mother,
to perform this last sad office to her murdered
child. Unwilling as it might naturally be supposed
she was, to comply, “he beat her,” regardless of the
indignant murmurs of her fettered countrymen, whom
in the barbarous plenitude of secure tyranny, he permitted
to be spectators of this horrible scene—“he
beat her, until he made her take up the child and carry
it to the side of the vessel, and then she dropped it
into the sea, turning her head another way, that she
might not see it!”<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Another instance occurs in this
chapter, not perhaps of more cruelty, though of
greater magnitude.</p>

<p>A ship from Africa, with about four hundred
slaves on board, struck upon some shoals, called the
Morant Keys, distant eleven leagues, S. S. E. off the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
east end of Jamaica. The officers and seamen of the
ship landed in their boats, carrying with them arms
and provisions. The slaves were left on board in their
irons and shackles. This happened in the night
time. When morning came, it was discovered that
the negroes had got out of their irons, and were busy
making rafts, upon which they placed the women
and children; the men, who were <ins class="corr" id="tn-11" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'capable of swiming'">
capable of swimming</ins>, attended upon the rafts, whilst they drifted before
the wind towards the island where the seamen
had landed. From an apprehension that the negroes
would consume the water and provisions which the
seamen had landed, they came to the resolution of
destroying them, by means of their fire-arms and other
weapons. As the poor wretches approached the
shore they actually destroyed between three and four
hundred of them. Out of the whole cargo only thirty
three or thirty four were saved and brought to
Kingston, where they were sold at public vendue.</p>

<p>When the ships arrive at their destined ports, the
cargo of slaves is sold, either by scramble or vendue.
The sale by scramble is described:—“A great
number of people come on board with tallies in their
hands (the ship being first darkened with sails and covered
round; the men slaves placed on the main
deck, and the women on the quarter deck), and rush
through the barricado door <ins class="corr" id="tn-11a" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'with the ferociety'">
with the ferocity</ins> of brutes. Some have three or four handkerchiefs tied
together, to encircle as many as they think fit for
their purpose.” This is a very general mode of sale,
and so terrifies the poor negroes, that forty or fifty at
a time have leaped into the sea; these, however, the
witness believes, have been taken up again: the women
have got away and run about the town as if they
were mad. The slaves sold by public auction or vendue,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
are generally the refuse, or sickly slaves. These
are in such a state of health, that they sell greatly under
price. They have been known to be sold for five
dollars, a guinea, and even a single dollar each. Some
that are deemed not worth buying are left to expire
in the place of sale, for nobody gives them any thing
to eat or drink, and some of them live three days in
that situation! In the sale no care is taken to prevent
the reparation of relations; they are separated (says
the evidence) like sheep and lambs by the butcher.
Making the slaves walk the plank, is a term used for
throwing them overboard when provisions are scarce.
Sometimes the ships lose more than half their cargoes
by the small-pox; at others they bury a quarter or
one-third on the passage, owing to various other causes
of mortality: and it is confessed by the planters,<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
that half the slaves die in the seasoning, after arrival
in the West-Indies. Surgeon Wilson says, that of the
death of two thirds of those who died in his ship, the
primary cause was melancholy. The disorders which
carry off the slaves in such numbers, are ascribed by
Falconbridge to a diseased mind, sudden transitions
from heat to cold, a putrid atmosphere, wallowing
in their own excrements, and being shackled together.</p>

<p>The captains, surgeons, &amp;c. who have quitted the
African slave-trade, uniformly declare the reason to
have been, that they could not conscientiously continue
in it: they say, that it is an unnatural, iniquitous,
and villainous trade, founded on injustice
and treachery; manifestly carried on by oppression
and cruelty, and not unfrequently terminating in
murder. Capt. Hall says, he quitted it (in opposition
to lucrative offers) from a conviction that it
was perfectly illegal, and founded in blood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span></p>

<p>The Fourth Chapter gives an account of the general
estimation and treatment of the slaves in the
West-Indies. Dr. Jackson says, that the negroes
are generally esteemed a species of inferior beings,
whom the right of purchase gives the owner a power
of using at his will. T. Woolrich says, he never
knew the best master in the West-Indies use his slaves
so well, as the worst master his servants in England:
that their state is inconceivable—that a sight of a
gang would convince more than all words.</p>

<p>Slaves are either Field Slaves, or in or out Door Slaves.</p>

<p>The field-slaves begin their work at break of day.
They work in rows, without exception under the
whip of drivers, and the weak are made to keep up
with the strong. They continue their labour (with
two intermissions, half an hour during the morning,
and two hours at noon) till sun set. In the intervals
they are made to pick grass for the cattle. Cook has
known pregnant women worked and flogged a few
days before their delivery. Some, however, are a little
indulged when in that state. After the month they
work with the children on their backs. In the crop-season
the labour is of much longer duration<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>. The
slaves sometimes work so long that they cannot help
sleeping, and then it not unfrequently happens, that
their arms are caught in the mill and torn off. They
are said to be allowed one day in seven for rest, but
this time is necessarily employed in raising food for
the other days, and gathering grass for their master’s
cattle. The best allowance of food is at Barbadoes,
which is a pint of grain for twenty four hours, and
half a rotten herring when to be had. When the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
herrings are unfit for the whites, they are bought up
by planters for the slaves. Some allow nine pints of
corn a week, and about one pound of salt fish, which
is the greatest allowance mentioned in the whole course
of the evidence. Some have no provision but what
they raise themselves, and they are frequently so fatigued
by the labour of the rest of the week, as
scarcely to be able to work for their own support on
the Sunday. And the land allotted them for this
purpose is often at the distance of three miles from
their houses; it would, however, be quite ample for
their support, were they allowed time sufficient for
its cultivation. Sometimes when they have been at
the pains of clearing their land, their masters take it
for canes, and give them wood land instead of it.
This hardship some have so taken to heart as to die.
Putrid carcases are burnt; if they were buried, the
slaves would dig them up and eat them, which would
breed distempers among them. They are sometimes
driven by extreme hunger to steal at the hazard of
their lives. They are badly clothed; one half of
them go almost naked. The slaves in general have
no bed or bedding at all. Their houses are built with
four poles and thatched. They have little or no property.
All the evidence (to whom the question has
been proposed) agree in answering, that they never
knew or heard of a field-slave ever amassing such a
sum, as enabled him to purchase his own freedom.
The artificers, such as house carpenters, coopers, masons,
the drivers and head slaves, are better off. The
owners of women let them out for prostitution, and
flog them, if they do not bring home full wages.</p>

<p>The negroes, when whipped, are suspended by the
arms, with weights at their feet. They are first
whipped with a whip made of cow-skin (which cuts<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
out the flesh, whereas the military whips cut only
the skin) and afterwards with ebony bushes (which
are more prickly than thorn bushes in this country)
in order to let out the congealed blood. Dr. Harrison
thinks the whipping too severe to be inflicted
on any human being: he could lay two or three fingers
into the wounds of a man whipped for not coming
when he was called. Many receive from one
hundred and fifty to two hundred lashes at a time;
and in two or three days this is repeated: they wash
the raw parts with pickle; this appears from the convulsions
it occasions, more cruel than whipping; but
it is done to prevent mortification. After severe
whipping, they are worked all day without food, except
what their friends may give them out of their
own poor pittance. <ins class="corr" id="tn-15" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'They are retured'">
They are returned</ins> to their stocks
at night, and worked next day as before. This
cruel treatment his made many commit suicide. Cook
has known fourteen slaves, who, in consequence
thereof, ran into the woods and cut their throats
together. These severe punishments are frequent.
The scars made by whipping last to old age. T. Woolrich
has seen their backs one undistinguished mass of
lumps, holes, and furrows. They sometimes die of
mortification of the wounds. A planter flogged
his driver to death, and boasted of having so done.</p>

<p>Under the head of Extraordinary Punishments, (for
those already named are reckoned only ordinary), mention
is made of iron collars with hooks<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>, heavy cattle
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
chains, and a half hundred weight fastened to
them, which the negroes are forced to drag after
them, when working in the field, suspending by the
hands ’till the fingers mortify; flogging with ebony
bushes ’till they are forced to go on all fours, unable
to get up, being tied up to the branch of a tree, with
a heavy weight round the neck, exposed to the noon-day
sun—thumb-screws; a man was put on the picket,
so long as to occasion a mortification of his foot
and hand, on suspicion of robbing his master, a public
officer, of a sum of money, which it afterwards
appeared, the master had taken himself. Yet the
master was privy to the punishment, and the slave had
no compensation. He was punished by order of the
master, who did not then chuse to make it known that
he himself had made use of the money. A girl’s ears
were nailed to a post, afterwards torn away, and clipt
off close to her head, with a pair of <ins class="corr" id="tn-16" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'large scissars'">
large scissors</ins>; besides this, she was unmercifully flogged, and all
for—<span class="allsmcap">BREAKING A PLATE, OR SPILLING A CUP
OF TEA</span>! A negro, impelled by hunger, had stolen
part of a turkey, his master caused him to be held down,
and, with his own hands, <ins class="corr" id="tn-16a" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'took a hammar'">
took a hammer</ins> and punch and knocked out four of his teeth. The hand is cut
off if lifted up against a white man, and the leg for
running away. A planter sent for a surgeon to cut
off the leg of a negro who had run away. On the
surgeon’s refusing to do it, the planter took an iron
bar, and broke the leg in pieces, and then the surgeon
took it off. This planter did many such acts of
cruelty, and all with impunity. The practice of dropping
hot lead upon the negroes, is here mentioned.
H. Ross saw a young female suspended by her wrists<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
to a tree, swinging to and fro, while her master applied
a lighted torch to the different parts of her writhing
body. It was notorious that Ruthie tortured so
many of his negroes to death, that he was obliged to
sell his estate. Another planter, in the same Island<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>,
destroyed forty slaves out of sixty (in three years) by
severity. The rest of the conduct of this infamous
wretch was cancelled by the Committee of the House
of Commons, as containing circumstances too horrible
to be given to the world. We, however, go on
to read of knocking on the head and stabbing, of a hot
iron forced between the teeth, of a slave thrown into
the boiling juice, and killed, of a negro shot and his
head cut off. And it appears, that the women, deemed
of respectability and rank, not only order and
superintend, but sometimes actually inflict with their
own hands severe punishments on their slaves.</p>

<p>The offences for which the before-mentioned punishments
are inflicted are, not coming into the field
in time, not picking a sufficient quantity of grass,
not appearing willing to work, when in fact sick and
not able; for staying too long on an errand, for not
coming immediately when called, for not bringing
home (the women) the full weekly sum enjoined by
their owners; for running away, and for theft, to
which they are often driven by hunger.</p>

<p>Under the head of “Extraordinary Punishments,”
some appear to have suffered for running away, or
for lifting up a hand against a white man, or for breaking
a plate, or spilling a cup of tea, or to extort confession.
Others again, in the moments of sudden resentment,
and one on a diabolical pretext, which the
master held out to the world to conceal <ins class="corr" id="tn-17" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'his own villany'">
his own villainy</ins>, and which he <em>knew</em> to be <em>false</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span></p>

<p>The slaves have little or no redress against ill-usage
of any sort; the laws to restrict punishment are a
mere farce, and universally disregarded, or when pretended
to be observed they are in divers ways effectually
evaded: besides, the evidence of a Black is
in no case whatever admitted against a White Man;
which circumstance alone is enough to deprive the
negroes of all legal protection whatever, were the
laws, in other respects, ever so just and salutary.
Lieutenant Davidson was so hurt at the severe and
frequent whippings of one of the women, that he complained
to a magistrate, who said, “he had nothing
to do with it.”</p>

<p>The particular instances mentioned in the evidence,
of slaves dying in consequence of severe and
cruel treatment from their masters, were not punished,
though generally known; nor do the perpetrators
of <ins class="corr" id="tn-18" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'these barbaraties'">
these barbarities</ins> appear to have suffered any
disgrace!</p>

<p>If you speak to a negro of future punishments, he
says,——“Why should a poor negro be punished?
he does no wrong? fiery cauldrons, and such things,
are reserved for white people, as punishments for the
oppression of slaves.”</p>

<p>In the Fifth Chapter, it is proved, by such as have
seen them in their own country, that the natives of
Africa are equal to the Europeans in their natural capacities,
feelings, affections, and moral character.
They manufacture gold and iron, in some respects,
equal to the European Artists—also cloth and leather
with uncommon neatness; the former they die blue,
yellow, brown and orange. They are skilled in making
indigo and soap, and pottery wares, and prepare salt
for their own use from the sea water. They also
make ropes with aloes. With respect to their moral<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
character, they are very honest and hospitable: grateful
and affectionate, harmless and innocent; punctual
in their dealings, and as capable of virtue as the
Whites. They are susceptible of all the social virtues:
generosity, fidelity, and gratitude, are allowed them
by Dr. Stuart. These virtues Dr. Jackson enumerates,
and adds charity to all in distress, and a strong
attachment on the part of parents to their children.
T. Woolrich says, he never knew of an African, who
could express himself, that did not believe in the existence
of a supreme Being.</p>

<p>In the Sixth and Seventh Chapters it appears that
the natives possess industry and a spirit of commerce,
sufficient for carrying on a new trade; that their country
abounds with, and might easily be made still more
productive of, many and various articles of commerce;
but that the traffic in slaves is an insuperable impediment
to opening a new trade.</p>

<p>In the Eighth Chapter it is inquired, whether the
slave trade be not a grave (instead of a nursery) of
the seamen employed in it.</p>

<p>It appears by the muster-rolls of Liverpool and
Bristol, that in 350 vessels, 12,263 men were employed,
out of whom 2643 were lost, that is to say,
more than a fifth of the whole number employed, or
more than seven in every single voyage, besides nearly
one half of those who go out with the ships are constantly
left behind.</p>

<p>Capt. Hall (of the merchant’s service) says that
the crews of the African ships, when they arrive in
the West-Indies, are the most miserable objects he ever
met with in any country in his life: he does not know
a single instance to the contrary. He has frequently
seen them with their toes rotted off, their legs swelled
to the size of their thighs, and in an ulcerated state all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
over &amp;c. &amp;c. This account is confirmed by Capt.
Hall of the navy. Sir W. Young is of opinion, that
a trade to Africa in the natural productions of the
country, would not be attended with more inconvenience
to the health of the seamen employed in it, than
the present West-India Trade.</p>

<p>In the Ninth Chapter we find that the seamen employed
in the slave trade are in general barbarously
used. They are worse fed both in quantity and quality
of food than the seamen in other trades. They
have little or no shelter night or day from the inclemency
of the weather during the whole of the middle
passage. They are inhumanly treated when ill, and
subjected to the fury of the impassioned officers for
very trifles. A boy, to avoid the cruel treatment of
his officer, jump’d overboard, and was drowned. A
man was killed with a hand spike for being very ill
and unable to work. Six men were chained together
by their necks, legs, and hands, for making their
escape from the vessel; they were allowed only a plantain
a day; they all died in their chains; one of
them (Thomas Jones a very good seaman) raving
mad! The evidence proves that instances of wanton
cruelty, and inhuman treatment in general, are numerous,
various and frequent. One man, with both
his legs in irons and his neck in an iron collar, was
chained to the boat for three months, and very often
most inhumanly beaten for complaining of his situation,
both by the captain and other officers. His allowance
of provisions was so small that (after his release
from the boat, on account of extreme weakness)
he begged something to eat, saying that if it were not
given him he should die:—the captain reproached
him, beat him, and bid him die and be damned. The
man died in the night. This was in the Ship Sally,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
on board of which ill-treatment was common. Another
man was deliberately, by a series of shocking barbarities,
murdered.</p>

<p>Sir Geo. Young remarks that a ship of the line
might be presently manned by the sailors who wish
to escape from the miseries of African ships. One
poor young man, when dying in consequence of the
ill treatment he had received from the captain, said
(which were the last words A. Falconbridge heard
him speak) “I cannot punish him (meaning the captain)
but God will.” The sailors when sick are beaten
for being lazy, till they die under the blows!</p>

<p>“If this be the real situation of things, how happens
it (the reader may perhaps ask) that the objects
of such tyranny and oppression should not obtain redress,
and that our courts of law should not have to
decide upon more cases of this kind, than they have
at present?” It is answered, “these objects are generally
without friends and money, without which the
injured will seek for justice but in vain; and because
the peculiarity of their situation is an impediment to
their endeavours for redress.” Whoever wishes for
a more particular answer to this question, may meet
with it in “Clarkson’s Essay on the Impolicy of the
African Slave-Trade,” (page 52) from which the
question and the above general reply are quoted.</p>

<p>If it should still be asked, “how it happens that
seamen enter for slave vessels, when such general ill
usage on board of them can hardly fail of being
known?” the reply must be taken from the evidence,
“that whereas some of them enter voluntarily, the
greater part of them are trepanned; for that it is the
business of certain landlords to make them intoxicated,
and get them into debt, after which <em>their only alternative
is a Guineaman <ins class="corr" id="tn-21" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'or a Goal'">
or a Gaol</ins></em>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span></p>

<p>In the Tenth Chapter it is proved not to be true,
what some say, that the natives of Africa are happier
in the European colonies than in their own country.
They love their own country, but destroy themselves
in the colonies, &amp;c. &amp;c. But any comparison
between the two situations is as (H. Ross says, tho’ on
another occasion) “<em>an insult to common sense</em>.”</p>

<p>The Eleventh, Twelfth, and Thirteenth Chapters
are on the subjects of negro population in the colonies,
and plainly shew that the importation of fresh Africans
might immediately be superceded, by the introduction
of general good treatment, and of certain salutary
regulations therein suggested.</p>

<p>The Fourteenth Chapter is employed to demonstrate,
from the evidence before the committee, that
the colonists would be able to carry on the necessary
cultivation of their lands, without a fresh importation
of slaves while the generation immediately succeeding
the regulations proposed, were growing up to supply
the vacancies occasioned by the natural deaths of the
slaves of all ages, now in their possession.</p>

<p>The Fifteenth Chapter inquires, whether there be
not a prevailing opinion in the colonies, that it is
cheaper to buy or import slaves than thus to increase
them by population. And whether the very reverse
of this opinion be not true: namely, that it is more
profitable to breed than to import. The result of
this inquiry is clearly in favour of the <em>immediate</em> Abolition
of the African Slave Trade. The same may
be said of the sixteenth <em>and last</em> chapter, in which it
is considered. Whether it be more political to extend
the cultivation of the colonies by the continuance
of the slave-trade, or wait till the rising generation
shall be capable of performing it.</p>

<p>Having thus taken a general view of the most<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
striking features of the evidence for the abolition of
the traffic in the human species, as carried on by the
English on the coast of Africa, it might not be improper
to close it with the declaration of a virtuous
and wise Senator, whose indefatigable labours on behalf
of the oppressed Africans, cannot fail to insure
him the unfeigned respect of every lover of freedom
and humanity:</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">The abolition of the slave trade</span>
(<em>says he</em>) <span class="allsmcap">IS INDISPENSIBLY REQUIRED OF US,
NOT ONLY BY RELIGION AND MORALITY, BUT
BY EVERY PRINCIPLE OF SOUND POLICY</span><a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>.”</p>

<p>The noble exordium of another able advocate of
the same righteous cause, must not however be omitted
in this place: The House of Commons being now
apprized of the nature of this trade, having received
evidence, having had the facts undeniably established,
knowing, in short, <em>what the Slave-Trade was</em>, he declared,
that if they did not, by the vote of that night,
mark to all mankind their abhorrence of a practice so
enormous, so savage, so repugnant to all laws, human
and divine, it would be more scandalous, and more defaming,
in the eyes of the country, and of the world,
than any vote which any House of Commons had
ever given. He desired them seriously to reflect, before
they gave their votes, what they were about to
do that evening. If they voted that the Slave Trade
should not be abolished, they would, by their vote that
night, give a <em>Parliamentary sanction</em> to <span class="smcap">Rapine</span>, <span class="smcap">Robbery</span>
and <span class="smcap">Murder</span>; for a system of rapine, robbery,
and murder, the Slave Trade had now <em>most clearly</em>
been proved to be<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span></p>

<p>It remains now to recommend, as earnestly and as
strongly as possible, to the inhabitants of this Land of
Freedom individually, a particular and serious attention
to <span class="allsmcap">THE ABSOLUTE NECESSITY, ON EVERY
CONSIDERATION OF MORALITY AND JUSTICE, OF
PUTTING AN END TO A PRACTICE SO PREGNANT
WITH CIRCUMSTANCES OF TERROR AND ALARM
TO THIS COUNTRY</span>.</p>

<p>Much has been lately done, by the united friends of
equitable freedom, in circulating throughout the kingdom
important information on this interesting subject:
but much remains yet to be done. The minds of
many have been informed, and their indignation justly
kindled by the history of a commerce “<em>written
throughout in characters of blood</em><a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>.” But the understandings
it is to be fear’d, of a great majority of the
people of England, are still unenlightened. Should
the foregoing Short Sketch of the Evidence, awaken
the feelings, or quicken the attention, of any, in favour
of their greatly injured fellow-creatures, the oppressed
Africans, it is much to be wished, that they
will not hastily dismiss the subject from their recollection,
or suffer its painful impressions to be made
in vain: but seek a further acquaintance with the
evidence, which the more they examine, the stronger
will be their inducements to exert every power and
faculty they possess, for the purpose of procuring the
Abolition of the Slave-Trade. Let no one say, “my
situation of privacy and obscurity, precludes all possibility
of serving the cause”—for the greatest numbers
consist of units, and the most mighty exertions of
states and empires are but aggregates of individual
ability. Next to Members of Parliament, all who have
any just influence in the election of them, are particularly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
concerned to consider, how far the attainment
of the great end we have in view may depend upon
their conduct. We may certainly conclude, that whoever
is not a friend to the liberty of the meanest subject,
is not fit to be entrusted with that of the state:
and even those who have no vote, are nevertheless
comprehended in our idea of the public mind,—nor
is any man of sense and virtue, let his situation in a
free country be what it may, to be deemed of <em>no account</em>.
Upon his judgment, his voice (if not his
vote,) his example, much may depend. The discovery
of truth, the communication of useful knowledge,
and the exemplary recommendation of virtuous conduct,
may dignify a plebeian, as well as add lustre to
a crown. Even a negro slave, amidst the horrors of
a middle passage, and debased by every external circumstance
of degradation and misery that the imagination
can conceive, shall divide his meagre morsel<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
with the inhuman monster in distress, who stole him
from his native country, and his nearest connexions,
thereby returning all the <span class="allsmcap">GOOD</span> in his power, for all
the <span class="allsmcap">EVIL</span> his merciless enemy could inflict, and giving
an example of true benevolence of heart and real
greatness of mind, unsurpassed in the history of civilized
nations, and worthy of the best and purest of
all religions:—“<em>if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if
he thirst, give him drink</em><a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>.” Let no one, therefore,
think too meanly of himself when called upon to assist
in a good cause, seeing, that from the most abject
state of human wretchedness a lesson may sometimes
be learnt, and an influence imparted which the proudest
philosophy need not blush to own. The abolition<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
of the slave trade is an object of such high importance,
and so nearly concerns every one who has a mind to
comprehend, and a heart to feel, that no communication
or assistance is too <em>small</em>, nor any too <em>great</em>, to
be exerted upon this occasion.</p>

<p>Some people seem inclined to lend an ear to tales
of human woe, and feel a certain gratification in beholding
the exhibitions of tragedy, or in the perusal
of pathetic poetry, and the like. Even the case of
the oppressed Africans, when represented by their favourite
bards, or appearing in the form of the “<em>Dying
Slave</em>,” or the “<em>Negro’s Complaint</em>,” seem to possess,
if not charms to please, at least powers forcibly
to attract their willing attention, and to win their
sympathetic regard. Yet the evidence delivered before
the House of Commons, containing a true and
faithful account of the miseries and wickedness attendant
upon the traffic in their fellow-creatures, unembellished
by flourishes of rhetoric, undecorated with
the splendid habiliments of poetry, is almost in vain
recommended to their notice. Should they be prevailed
upon to cast their eye over a few pages of the
shocking history, they presently shut up the book—it
makes them shudder—they have read enough—such
horrid barbarities, such complicated sufferings,
are not to be endured even in imagination! But let
such remember—“that humanity consists not in a
squeamish ear—it consists not in a starting or shrinking
at such tales as these, but in a disposition of heart
to relieve misery, and to prevent the repetition of cruelty:—Humanity
appertains rather to the mind than
to the nerves, and prompts men to real, disinterested
endeavours to give happiness to their fellow-creatures<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>.”
It is therefore to be wished that no affection<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
of extreme sensibility, or <ins class="corr" id="tn-27" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'real effiminacy'">
real effeminacy</ins> of manners,
may disincline, or disqualify, for the service of humanity.
That extreme <span class="allsmcap">DELICACY</span> which deprives us,
if not of the disposition, yet of the ability to encounter
suffering for the sake of, and in order to help our
brethren in affliction, and under the <ins class="corr" id="tn-27a" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'severest oppession'">
severest oppression</ins>, is detrimental to its possessor, and injurious to
the community; it renders compassion a painful,
useless thing, and makes beneficence fruitless.</p>

<p>To the busy and the gay “<em>a great book is a great
evil</em>.” <span class="smcap">Two thousand pages in folio</span>, written
(like Ezekiel’s roll) within and without,—lamentations,
mourning and woe, stand but little chance of obtaining
<em>their</em> notice—even <span class="smcap">the Abstract of the
Evidence</span>, would detain some of them too long
from their eager pursuits of business, or their favourite
schemes of pleasure. This <span class="allsmcap">HASTY SKETCH</span> will
not, however, it may be presumed, encroach too
much upon their time; and well rewarded will the
compiler of it be, if it should prove a stimulus to
further investigation of the Evidence. No one knows
what opportunities he may have, or how far his influence
may extend, to assist the endeavours now using
for the abolition of a trade, the continued carrying
on of which, after being so fully apprized of its
dreadful enormity, may be expected (without the smallest
tincture of <ins class="corr" id="tn-27b" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'superstious fear'">
superstitious fear</ins>) to expose this nation
to the just punishment of <span class="smcap">Providence</span>.</p>

<p>Three nations, Juvan, Tubal, and Meshech, are
mentioned in Scripture<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> as having their principal
trade at Tyre in the <em>selling of men</em>. This circumstance
has been appealed to in vindication of the
African Slave-Trade:—but mark the sequel. In the
following chapter, verse 18, the Prophet addresses<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
the Prince of Tyre thus:—“Thou hast defiled thy
sanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquities, by the
iniquity of thy traffic: <em>therefore</em> will I bring forth a
fire from the midst of thee, it shall devour thee, and
I will bring thee to ashes upon the earth.” A prophecy
which has been remarkably fulfilled.</p>

<p>The great leader in the Debates of the House of
Commons on this momentous subject has declared—“That
interested as he may be supposed to be in the
final event of the question, he was comparatively indifferent
as to the then decision of the House. Whatever
they might do, the people of Great Britain, he
was confident, would abolish the slave-trade, when,
as would now soon happen, its injustice and cruelty
should be fairly laid before them. It was (said he) a
nest of serpents, which would never have endured so
long, but for the darkness in which they lay hid. The
light of day would now be let in upon them, and they
would vanish from the sight.”</p>

collar about his neck, with five long projecting spikes. His body, before
and behind, his breech, belly and thighs, were almost cut to pieces, and
with running soars all over them, and you might put your finger in some
of the wheals. He could not sit down, owing to his breech being in a
state of mortification, and it was impossible for him to lie down, from the
projection of the prongs. The boy came to the general to ask relief.
He was shocked at his appearance, and asked him what he had done to
suffer such a punishment, and who inflicted it. He said it was his master,
who lived about two miles from town, and that as he could not work, he
would give him nothing to eat.</p>

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
